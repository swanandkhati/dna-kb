This page shows a list of all data lineages sorted dashboard-wise in DNA.

Instructions to use the lineage view feature:

1. Please select your desired dashboard (whose lineage you wish to view) from the filter on top.
2. Click on each tile to view its upstream items. This opens the upstream item(s) for that SnowFlake object.<br />This object can be another view, or table.
3. Hover over each tile to see more information of that object.
4. **End of Line** indicates there are no further upstream object on that data line.<br />This has been implemented since some lines can be shorter and others longer for the same dashboard.
