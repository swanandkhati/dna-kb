## Iteration Tab			

These tabs contain the breakdown of each iteration/phase/into various action items and subtasks.		

The yellow `column B` has been formatted as a note and will give a high level list of activities for that particular iteration.		

`Column D` stands for DEPENDS/AFFECTS . Legend for those symbols is as follows:	

|Symbol|Explanation|
|---|---|
| II |This symbol is to be used for tasks that are independent and can be undertaken parallelly.|	
|-->| This symbol is to be used for tasks that depend upon another task. The convention is to write such task right below the one on which it depends.|
|ยง|This symbol represents the impact of all the tasks involved under one action item.|

`Column E` represents action items, which would be a reflection of the list of activities mentioned in column B.

> **Please discuss with Swanand Khati before adding any new symbols.**

When creating multiple iterations, please duplicate the tab by
> 1. Right Click on the tab button
> 2. Move or Copy
> 3. Select "create a copy"

Rename the tab when copy is completed. This will ensure all the functions implemented in the `ITERATION` tab are reflected in the new tabs as well.

`Column F` onwards is the calendar with team members filling in their time data.

To keep additional notes, please use the comment feature and tag relevant team member. An example is present in Cell ```=E3```.

Comments appear on hover.
